        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          When it comes to protecting lives and property, <span className="italic text-yellow-400">fire alarm systems are one of the most critical safety features</span> any building can have. Whether you manage a commercial property or are involved in new construction, understanding how these systems work—and why professional design and installation matters—can help you stay code-compliant and prepared for emergencies.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6">
          At <span className="italic text-yellow-400">ESF PROS INC</span>, fire safety is one of our core specialties. Here&apos;s a quick guide to what you should know about modern fire alarm systems.
        </p>

        {/* Why Fire Alarm Systems Matter */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-1">🧯 Why Fire Alarm Systems Matter</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          Fires can start unexpectedly from electrical faults, heating equipment, cooking, or even human error. A properly designed fire alarm system can:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6">
          <li>Detect fires early</li>
          <li>Alert occupants quickly</li>
          <li>Minimize property damage</li>
          <li>Ensure faster emergency response</li>
          <li>Help you pass inspections and meet building codes</li>
        </ul>

        {/* Types of Fire Alarm Systems */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-1">🔍 Types of Fire Alarm Systems</h3>
        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-300 mt-2">1. Conventional Systems</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          These systems divide a building into zones. If an alarm goes off, you’ll know <span className="italic">which zone</span> the signal is coming from—but not the exact device.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <li>✅ Best for: Small to medium-sized buildings</li>
          <li>🔧 Simple and cost-effective</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-300 mt-2">2. Addressable Systems</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          Each device (smoke detector, pull station, etc.) has a unique address. The system identifies <span className="italic">exactly which device</span> triggered the alarm.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <li>✅ Best for: Large or complex buildings</li>
          <li>🔧 Highly reliable and programmable</li>
          <li>📍 Precise location tracking for faster response</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-300 mt-2">3. Wireless Fire Alarm Systems</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          Wireless detectors communicate with the control panel via radio signals—ideal for retrofit projects or buildings where cabling is difficult.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6">
          <li>✅ Best for: Historic buildings or remodels</li>
          <li>🔧 Fast installation, less invasive</li>
        </ul>

        {/* Key Components */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-1">⚙ Key Components of a Fire Alarm System</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6">
          <li>Smoke & Heat Detectors – Automatically detect fire conditions</li>
          <li>Manual Pull Stations – Allow occupants to trigger an alarm</li>
          <li>Notification Devices – Horns, strobes, and speakers to alert building occupants</li>
          <li>Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP) – The brain of the system</li>
          <li>Backup Power Supply – Ensures functionality during power outages</li>
          <li>Monitoring System – Connects to a 24/7 response center</li>
        </ul>

        {/* Why Professional Installation */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-1">🛠 Why Professional Installation Is Essential</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          A fire alarm system is <span className="italic">not plug-and-play.</span> It must be:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6">
          <li>Designed to meet local code and NFPA standards</li>
          <li>Properly integrated with sprinklers, elevators, and HVAC</li>
          <li>Programmed and tested by certified technicians</li>
          <li>Approved by the local AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6">
          Poor installation or code violations can delay occupancy, trigger fines, or worse—fail to protect people in a real emergency.
        </p>
