        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Electricity powers everything in our homesâ€”from the lights above us to the appliances we use daily. But when mishandled, it can also become a serious hazard. At <span className="italic text-yellow-400">ESF PROS INC</span>, we prioritize safety above all, and that includes helping homeowners understand the basics of <span className="font-semibold">electrical safety</span>.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6">
          Here are the <span className="font-semibold">top 5 electrical safety tips</span> every homeowner should know:
        </p>

        {/* Tip 1 */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-1">1. Never Overload Outlets</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          Plugging too many devices into one outlet or power strip can cause overheating and increase the risk of electrical fires. Spread out high-wattage appliances like space heaters, microwaves, and toasters across multiple outlets to reduce the load.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="italic text-yellow-300 mb-6">
          Pro Tip: If you find yourself constantly using extension cords, it may be time to upgrade your electrical system to add more outlets.
        </blockquote>

        {/* Tip 2 */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-1">2. Inspect Cords and Plugs Regularly</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          Frayed wires, cracked insulation, and loose plugs are signs of wear and tear that shouldnâ€™t be ignored. Damaged cords can lead to shocks, sparks, or fire hazards.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="italic text-yellow-300 mb-6">
          What to do: Replace damaged cords immediately, and never use electrical tape as a long-term fix.
        </blockquote>

        {/* Tip 3 */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-1">3. Use GFCIs in Wet Areas</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) are essential in bathrooms, kitchens, garages, and outdoor spaces. They automatically shut off power if they detect a ground faultâ€”protecting you from shock in damp environments.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="italic text-yellow-300 mb-6">
          Reminder: Test your GFCI outlets monthly using the &quot;Test&quot; and &quot;Reset&quot; buttons.
        </blockquote>

        {/* Tip 4 */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-1">4. Hire a Licensed Electrician for Major Work</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          DIY may work for painting or minor repairs, but when it comes to electrical upgrades or troubleshooting, leave it to the professionals. Incorrect wiring or installations can lead to costly repairsâ€”or worse, serious injuries.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="italic text-yellow-300 mb-6">
          Trust the Pros: Always hire a <span className="text-white">licensed, insured electrician</span> for installations, upgrades, or troubleshooting.
        </blockquote>

        {/* Tip 5 */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-1">5. Install and Maintain Smoke Detectors</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          Every home should have smoke detectors installed in bedrooms, hallways, and near electrical panels. They are your first line of defense in detecting electrical fires early.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="italic text-yellow-300 mb-6">
          Bonus Tip: Replace the batteries twice a year, and test your alarms monthly to ensure theyâ€™re working.
        </blockquote>
